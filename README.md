# KanjiDicParse
This repo is currently just for experimenting with xml parsing and is not complete. My end goal is to store the data in a SQLite database.

I don't often use Python, so I believe this could be good practice.

Kanji Dictionary file used is called *KANJIDIC2* and is located [here](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project)
